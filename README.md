# When to Wake

Sleepyti.me is a great website, but it looks terrible on a phone.

Bedtime by Zachary Howe is a mobile app for iPhone but it's old and outdated. It doesn't take advantage of the full height of the iPhone 5 and it looks crummy.

When to Wake is a modern version. It's nice to look at and it works on any device and any screen size.


## The logic behind sleepyti.me

Accorinding to sleepyti.me, a sleep cycle takes 90 minutes, a good night's sleep consists of 5 - 6 cycles a night, and it takes a human 14 minutes to fall asleep on average.

This logic informs the calculations made on When to Wake.
